Biocard

Proof-of-concept application showing secured authentication using biometrics. It is my final-year project at Ecole des Mines de Saint-Etienne - cycle ISMIN. 

This proof-of-concept application has to make an efficient demonstration of our technology : ‘simplicity of use’ and ‘quickness’ are the key words. People have also to trust it so we need to make them feel that the application is safe.
We worked with a third student on this part of the project : Thomas Bobet from the Visual Communication School of Aix-en-provence. With his experience in this type of projects, he helped us to build an identity for the brand and the product, starting from the above key words. Then he worked on the use scenario and he finally provided us with footages to put in it.
The result is very good : the application is ‘design’ and pretty easy to use for people. There are an introduction clip, animated menus and several animations linked with the user actions. The technology is well highlighted and people may easily understand that it can be used in their daily life.
Now we are using an external fingerprint reader, but eventually it will be included in smartphones and tablets hardware. Apple iPhone 5S and Samsung Galaxy S5 are now the first smartphones on the market to propose this feature.
